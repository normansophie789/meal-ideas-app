# Meal Ideas React App

This is a ReactJS app that uses the Food2Fork API (found [here](https://www.food2fork.com/about/api)) to 
display a list of meal ideas with links to their respective recipes.

To use this app, simply type the ingredient(s) into the input field and submit.

To seach for meals based on multiple ingredients, seperate each ingredient with a comma, like so:

`onions, chicken`
